## Intro

The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is a developer friendly journal for
research software packages.

JOSS is an academic journal (ISSN 2475-9066) with a formal peer-review process
that is designed to improve the quality of the software submitted. Upon
acceptance into JOSS, we mint a CrossRef DOI for your paper and we list it on
the [JOSS website](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/published).
