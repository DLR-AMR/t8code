Its creation is a fundamental, necessary task in executing most parallel, element-based computer simulations. Common methods differ in that the ghost layer may either be inherently part of the mesh data structure that is maintained and modified, or kept separate and constructed/deleted as needed. In this work, we present a design following the latter approach, which we chose for its modularity of algorithms and data structures. We target arbitrary adaptive, nonconforming forest-of-trees meshes of mixed element shapes, such as cubes, prisms, and tetrahedra, and restrict ourselves to ghost elements across mesh faces. Our algorithm has low code complexity and redundancy since we reduce it to generic codimension-1 subalgorithms that can be flexibly combined. We recover older algorithms for cubic elements as special cases and optimize further using recursive, amortized tree searches and traversals.},

trees in the cells of an unstructured coarse mesh. This lets us combine the speed
and simpler management of structured refinement trees with the more flexible mesh
generation of the unstructured coarse mesh.
But this creates a conflict between performance and geometrical accuracy. If we
favor speed we reduce the cells in our coarse mesh and hence reduce the accuracy
of our geometrical representation. If we want more accurate results we generate a
finer coarse mesh and lose performance by managing more cells in our unstructured
coarse mesh.
To mitigate this conflict we present the prototype of an geometry description
which we implement in an already existing library. With this description we build
geometry adapted hexahedral refinement trees, which also support high-order curved
boundary cells. We also present examples on how to use this description.
Moreover, we test the speedup of this new algorithm compared with coarse meshes
with different geometrical errors.},

  title = {Evaluation and generic application scenarios for curved hexahedral adaptive mesh refinement},
  abstract = {In (dynamic) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) an input mesh is refined or coarsened to the need of the numerical application. This refinement happens with no respect to the originally meshed domain and is therefore limited to the geometrical accuracy of the original input mesh. We presented a novel approach to equip this input mesh with additional geometry information, to allow refinement and high-order cells based on the geometry of the original domain.
We already showed a limited implementation of this algorithm. Now we evaluate this prototype with a numerical application and we prove its influence on the accuracy of certain numerical results. To be as practical as possible, we implement the ability to import meshes generated by Gmsh and equip them with the needed geometry information. Furthermore, we improve the mapping algorithm, which maps the geometry information of the boundary of a cell into the cell's volume.
With these preliminary steps done, we use out new approach in a simulation of the advection of a concentration along the boundary of a sphere shell and past the boundary of a rotating cylinder. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach in comparison to the conventional refinement of cells to answer our research question: How does the performance and accuracy of the hexahedral curved domain AMR algorithm compare to linear AMR when solving the advection equation with the linear finite volume method?
To answer this question, we show the influence of curved AMR on our simulation results and see, that it is even able to outperform far finer linear meshes in terms of accuracy. We also see that the current implementation of this approach is too slow for practical usage. We can therefore prove the benefits of curved AMR in certain, geometry-related application scenarios and show possible improvements to make it more feasible and practical in the future.},

  abstract = {Adaptive mesh refinement generally aims to increase computational efficiency without compromising the accuracy of the numerical solution. However it is an open question in which regions the spatial resolution can actually be coarsened without affecting the accuracy of the result. This question is investigated for a specific example of dry atmospheric convection, namely the simulation of warm air bubbles. For this purpose a novel numerical model is developed that is tailored towards this specific application. The compressible Euler equations are solved with a discontinuous Galerkin method. Time integration is done with an IMEX-method and the dynamic grid adaptivity uses space filling curves via the AMATOS function library. So far the model is able to simulate dry flow in two-dimensional geometry without subgrid-scale modeling. The model is tested with three standard test cases. An error indicator is introduced for a warm air bubble test case which allows one to compare the accuracy between different choices of refinement regions without knowing the exact solution. Essentially this is done by comparing features of the solution that are strongly sensitive to spatial resolution. For the rising warm air bubble the additional error by using adaptivity is smaller than 1\% of the total numerical error if the average number of elements used for the adaptive simulation is about a factor of two times smaller than the number used for the simulation with the uniform fine-resolution grid. Correspondingly the adaptive simulation is almost two times faster than the uniform simulation. Furthermore the adaptive simulation is more accurate than a uniform simulation when both use the same CPU-time.},

  abstract = {We describe a powerful methodology for numerical solution of 3-D self-gravitational hydrodynamics problems with unprecendented resolution. This code utilizes the technique of local adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), employing multiple grids at multiple levels of resolution. These grids are automatically and dynamically added and removed as necessary to maintain adequate resolution. This technology allows solution of problems that would be prohibitively expensive with methods using fixed resolution, and it is more versatile and efficient than competing methods of achieving variable resolution. The application of this technique to simulate the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, a key step in star formation is discussed. The simulation involves many orders of magnitude of variation in length scale as fragments form. In this paper we describe the methodology and present illustrative applications for both isothermal and nonisothermal cloud collapse. We describe the numerical Jeans condition, a new criterion for stability of self-gravitational gas dynamic problems. We find that the uniformly rotating, spherical clouds treated here first collapse to disks in the equatorial plane and then, in the presence of applied perturbations, form filamentary singularities that do not fragment while isothermal. As the collapse enters the non-isothermal phase, we show the evolutionary sequence that leads to the formation of a binary system consisting of protostellar cores surrounded by distinct protostellar disks. The scale of the disks, of order 100 AU, is consistent with observations of gaseous disks surrounding single T-Tauri stars and debris disks surrounding systems such as Beta Pictoris.},

  abstract = {Abstract The ability to construct suitable computational meshes is currently a significant limiting factor in the development of compact high-order algorithms in very complex geometries. Compact high-order algorithms such as spectral element or p-type finite element techniques offer the potential of high accuracy if the solution is smooth and a well-behaved mapping exists between the local sub-domains and a standard region. In this paper we address the problem of coupling high-order algorithms with unstructured mesh generation and CAD representation techniques. We present three complementary strategies to alleviate the problem of generation of elemental regions with singular elemental mappings. The first strategy investigates the influence of an anisometric parametric surface representation on the quality of high-order unstructured meshes. We show that a straightforward splitting of a standard linear mesh for use in a high-order method can lead to the generation of distorted, possibly invalid, meshes even for simple computational domains such as cubes. The second strategy uses hybrid meshes applying prismatic elements near curvilinear boundaries. In the third and final strategy we investigate the use of curvature driven surface discretization to incorporate higher-order information about the surface into the mesh generation. Using the computational reconstruction of the arterial bypass graft as an example computational domain we demonstrate how the combination of all three strategies leads to a valid high-order discretization of the computational domain.

Two key steps in the procedure are the determination of the singular model edges and vertices, and the creation of geometrically graded elements around those entities. The other key step is the use of general curved element mesh modification procedures to correct any invalid elements created by the curving of mesh entities on the model boundary, which is required to ensure a properly geometric approximation of the domain.

abstract = {We introduce several parallel algorithms operating on a distributed forest of adaptive quadtrees/octrees. They are targeted at large-scale applications relying on data layouts that are more complex than required for standard finite elements, such as hp-adaptive Galerkin methods, particle tracking and semi-Lagrangian schemes, and in-situ post-processing and visualization. Specifically, we design algorithms to derive an adapted worker forest based on sparse data, to identify owner processes in a top-down search of remote objects, and to allow for variable process counts and per-element data sizes in partitioning and parallel file I/O. We demonstrate the algorithms’ usability and performance in the context of a particle tracking example that we scale to 21e9 particles and 64Ki MPI processes on the Juqueen supercomputer, and we describe the construction of a parallel assembly of variably sized spheres in space creating up to 768e9 elements on the Juwels supercomputer.},

abstract = {We present an efficient MPI-parallel geometric multigrid library for quadtree (2D) or octree (3D) grids with adaptive refinement. Cartesian 2D/3D and cylindrical 2D geometries are supported, with second-order discretizations for the elliptic operators. Periodic, Dirichlet, and Neumann boundary conditions can be handled, as well as free-space boundary conditions for 3D Poisson problems, for which we use an FFT-based solver on the coarse grid. Scaling results up to 1792 cores are presented. The library can be used to extend adaptive mesh refinement frameworks with an elliptic solver, which we demonstrate by coupling it to MPI-AMRVAC. Several test cases are presented in which the multigrid routines are used to control the divergence of the magnetic field in magnetohydrodynamic simulations.}

abstract = {An overview of the software design and data abstraction decisions chosen for deal.II, a general purpose finite element library written in C++, is given. The library uses advanced object-oriented and data encapsulation techniques to break finite element implementations into smaller blocks that can be arranged to fit users requirements. Through this approach, deal.II supports a large number of different applications covering a wide range of scientific areas, programming methodologies, and application-specific algorithms, without imposing a rigid framework into which they have to fit. A judicious use of programming techniques allows us to avoid the computational costs frequently associated with abstract object-oriented class libraries.The paper presents a detailed description of the abstractions chosen for defining geometric information of meshes and the handling of degrees of freedom associated with finite element spaces, as well as of linear algebra, input/output capabilities and of interfaces to other software, such as visualization tools. Finally, some results obtained with applications built atop deal.II are shown to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of this toolbox.},

    abstract = { A mathematical theory is developed for a class of a-posteriors error estimates of finite element solutions. It is based on a general formulation of the finite element method in terms of certain bilinear forms on suitable Hilbert spaces. The main theorem gives an error estimate in terms of localized quantities which can be computed approximately. The estimate is optimal in the sense that, up to multiplicative constants which are independent of the mesh and solution, the upper and lower error bounds are the same. The theoretical results also lead to a heuristic characterization of optimal meshes, which in turn suggests a strategy for adaptive mesh refinement. Some numerical examples show the approach to be very effective. }
