/* Interface for the data layout of the coarse trees.
 *
 * The layout is the same for replicated and partitioned meshes.
 * Each process stores a meta array of data arrays. In the replicated case this meta
 * array has only one entry wheras in the partitioned case there is one data array for
 * each processor from which local trees were received in the last partition step
 * (and only one meta array if the cmesh arised from a partitioned commit).
 *
 * Each dara arrays stores the local trees, the ghosts, face neighbor information
 * of the ghosts, face neihbor information of the trees and the attributes of the trees.
 * Furthermore we store for each tree and for each ghost to which data array they belong to.
 * So the data looks like:
 *
 * TODO: would be more logical to switch Ghost and Tree faces
 *
 * M_0:   | Trees | Ghosts | Ghost faces | Tree faces | Tree attributes | Ghost attributes
 * M_1:   | Trees | Ghosts | Ghost faces | Tree faces | Tree attributes | Ghost attributes
 *  .         .        .          .            .               .
 * M_n:   | Trees | Ghosts | Ghost faces | Tree faces | Tree attributes | Ghost attributes
 *
 * tree_to_proc:  | 0 | 0 | 1 | ... | n |  these are just random examples here
 * ghost_to_proc: | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | n |
 *
 *
 * Each tree T stores an offset to its Tree faces, such that (char*)&T + offset is
 * a pointer to the faces array.
 * The same holds for the ghost.
 * Also each tree stores the number of attributes and an offset relative to itself
 * to the first attribute entry of that tree.
 *
 * Tree faces:
 *
 * The data of Tree faces looks for each tree:
 *
 * | Treeid1 Treeid2  ... | ttf1 ttf2 ... | padding |
 *
 * Where padding is a number of unused bytes that makes the whole block a multiple
 * of 4 Bytes.
 * Treeid is a t8_locidx_t storing the local tree id for local tree neighbors and
 * the local ghost id + num_local_trees for ghost neighbors.
 * For the encoding of ttf (tree to face) see \ref t8_ctree_struct_t, ttf entries are int8_t
 * and the offset of ttf1 can be calculated from the Tree faces offset and the
 * class of the tree.
 *
 * Ghost faces:
 *
 * | Treeid1 Treeid2 ... | ttf1 ttf2 ... | padding |
 *
 * Where padding is a number of unused bytes that makes the whole block a multiple
 * of sizeof (void*) Bytes.
 * Treeidj is a t8_gloidx_t storing the global tree id for all neighbors.
 * For the encoding of ttf (tree to face) see \ref t8_ctree_struct_t, ttf entries are int8_t
 * and the offset of ttf1 can be calculated from the Tree faces offset and the
 * class of the tree.
 * Tree attributes:
 *
 * The data of Tree attributes looks like:
 *
 * TODO: This description seems incomplete. Why is it not Attij_data?
 *
 * | Att00_descr | Att01_descr | ... | Att10_descr | ... | Attrend_descr | Att1_data | Att2_data | ... |
 *                TODO: maybe insert padding here ||
 * Where Attij_descr is a descriptor of the j-th attribute data of tree i storing
 * - an offset to Atti_data starting from Atti0_descr
 * - package id of the attribute (int)
 * - key of the attribute (int)
 * The data type is t8_attribute_info_struct_t
 *
 * Attrend_descr only stores the offset of the end of this attributes block
 * (like an imaginary very last attribute);
 * using this info the size of each attribute can be computed as the difference
 * of the sizes of two consecutive attributes.
 *
 * padding is a number of nonused bytes to make the size of the descr block
 * a multiple of four.
 *
 *  TODO: maybe padding after the last Att_data is useful too
 *  TODO: We may also need padding between the attributes.
 *
