/* TODO: Implement cmesh_refine as follows:
 *        create a forest,
 *        refine to level 1
 *        build a ctree from each forest element
 *            this will need forest_element_transform_face (see p4est_quadrant_transform_face)
 *            which is not yet implemented */

/* A cmesh is refined uniformly by replacing each tree with a certain number
 * of subtrees. This number depends on the element class of the tree.
 * Per default these are:
 *  - Vertices cannot be refined,
 *  - Line become two sublines,
 *  - Quadrants become four subquads,
 *  - Triangles become four subtriangles,
 *  - Hexahedra become eight subhexahedra,
 *  - Tetrahedra become eight subtetrahedra,
 *  - Prism become eight subprisms,
 *  - Pyramids becom six subpyramids and four subtetrahedra.
 *
 * When refining a cmesh new treeid's and face neighbors have to be computed,
 * to this end it is necessary to specify a order of the children of each eclass
 * and an enumeration of the faces of each eclass.
 * The standard schemes are Morton for lines/quads/hexes
 * and Bey order for triangles/tets.
