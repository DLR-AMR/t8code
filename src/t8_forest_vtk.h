 * \param [in]  forest    The forest.
 * \param [in]  fileprefix The prefix of the output files. The meta file will be named \a fileprefix.pvtu .
 * \param [in]  write_treeid If true, the global tree id is written for each element.
 * \param [in]  write_mpirank If true, the mpirank is written for each element .
 * \param [in]  write_level If true, the refinement level is written for each element.
 * \param [in]  write_element_id If true, the global element id is written for each element.
 * \param [in]  curved_flag If true, write the elements as curved element types from vtk.
 * \param [in]  num_data  Number of user defined double valued data fields to write.
 * \param [in]  data      Array of t8_vtk_data_field_t of length \a num_data
 *                        providing the used defined per element data.
 *                        If scalar and vector fields are used, all scalar fields
 *                        must come first in the array.
