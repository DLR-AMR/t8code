/** \file t8_with_macro_error.h
 * This file defines macros to cause an error in user code when using
 * deprecated "T8_WITH_*" macros.
 * Unfortunately, the error will not be raised in #ifdef constructions (This is still an open TODO.).
 * With https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code/issues/1370 we switched all our macros
 * that control settings and external libraries to "T8_ENABLE_*".
 * Users might not have implmented that change and left "T8_WITH_*" in their code.
 * This could lead to unintentionally behaviour if the macros are ignored even if the
 * setting would have been enabled.
 * Hence, we define a macro that throws an error, whenever a "T8_WITH_*" is called.
 * This macro is defined for each "T8_ENABLE_*" option.
