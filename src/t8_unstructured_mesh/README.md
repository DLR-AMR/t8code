# t8_unstructured_mesh #
In this folder, we define an unstructured mesh interface.  
Some application codes are designed for unstructured or uniform meshes and cannot use t8code's tree-based structures directly. For this purpose, an iterable mesh data structure is created as an intermediate level in this folder.
