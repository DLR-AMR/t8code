This is a playground for implementations of the t8_element interface.
We collect implementations that are not recommended for production usage
but are rather used to investigate the possibilities of the t8_element interface.

So far, the following schems are implemented here:

t8_no_neighbors:
  This scheme only implements the quad element class.
  A quad refines into 4 subquads and the SFC is the Morton SFC as in
  the t8_default_scheme_quad.
  In this scheme, however, the elements do not have any face-neighbors.
  Thus, despite geometrically lying next to each other. 
  Calling t8_element_face_neighbor_inside will never return any neighbors.
  In particular, Ghost layers are empty for this scheme.
