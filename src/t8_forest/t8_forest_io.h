/** Write the forest in a parallel vtu format. Extended version.
 * See \ref t8_forest_write_vtk for the standard version of this function.
 * Writes one master .pvtu file and each process writes in its own .vtu file.
 * If linked and not otherwise specified, the VTK API is used.
 * If the VTK library is not linked, an ASCII file is written.
 * This may change in accordance with \a write_ghosts, \a write_curved and 
 * \a do_not_use_API, because the export of ghosts is not yet available with 
 * the VTK API and the export of curved elements is not available with the
 * inbuilt function to write ASCII files. The function will for example
 * still use the VTK API to satisfy \a write_curved, even if \a do_not_use_API 
 * is set to true.
 * Forest must be committed when calling this function.
 * This function is collective and must be called on each process.
 * \param [in]      forest              The forest to write.
 * \param [in]      fileprefix          The prefix of the files where the vtk will
 *                                      be stored. The master file is then fileprefix.pvtu
 *                                      and the process with rank r writes in the file
 *                                      fileprefix_r.vtu.
 * \param [in]      write_treeid        If true, the global tree id is written for each element.
 * \param [in]      write_mpirank       If true, the mpirank is written for each element.
 * \param [in]      write_level         If true, the refinement level is written for each element.
 * \param [in]      write_element_id    If true, the global element id is written for each element.
 * \param [in]      write_ghosts        If true, each process additionally writes its ghost elements.
 *                                      For ghost element the treeid is -1.
 * \param [in]      write_curved        If true, write the elements as curved element types from vtk.
 * \param [in]      do_not_use_API      Do not use the VTK API, even if linked and available.
 * \param [in]      num_data            Number of user defined double valued data fields to write.
 * \param [in]      data                Array of t8_vtk_data_field_t of length \a num_data
 *                                      providing the user defined per element data.
 *                                      If scalar and vector fields are used, all scalar fields
 *                                      must come first in the array.
 * \return  True if successful, false if not (process local).
 * See also \ref t8_forest_write_vtk .
