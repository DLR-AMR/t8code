 *                        The files \a fileprefix.node, \a fileprefix.ele and

 * \param [in] partition  In the future this flag can decide whether the returned
 *                        cmesh is partitioned or not. Currently it is always replicated.
 * \param [in] comm       The mpi communicator to be used.
 * \param [in] do_dup     Whether \a comm should be duplicated by cmesh.
 * \return                A committed, replicated cmesh constructed from the info
 *                        in the TRIANGLE files.
