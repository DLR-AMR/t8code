# A hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
# This hook checks whether the code is properly indented using
# the provided indent script.
# Move into .git/hooks folder and name it "pre-commit".
# Called by "git commit" with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.
