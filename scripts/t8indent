# We use clang-format to indent our code. There are different base styles
# available, but we use a modification. The options for this modification
# are located in the .clang-format file.
# We have to use the -i argument, so that clang-format directly alters the
# files instead of printing the changes to stdout. The --style=file
# arguments tells clang-format to look for a *.clang-format file.
