# This script searches for lines containing a macro definition in the style of '#ifdef T8_ENABLE_' 
# in the specified file and processes each matching line.
# It uses 'grep' to find all occurrences of '#ifdef T8_ENABLE_' in the file located 
# at the path stored in the variable 'file_path'. The '-n' option with 'grep' 
# ensures that the line numbers of the matching lines are included in the output.
# The output of 'grep' is then piped into a 'while' loop, which reads each line 
# and splits it into the line number and the line content using ':' as the delimiter.
# Variables:
# - file_path: The path to the file to be searched.
# - line_number: The line number where the macro definition is found.
# - line: The content of the line where the macro definition is found.
