# This is t8code's indentation ignore file.
# All files listed here are ignored by out t8indent.sh script and thus not 
# indented according to our indentation guidelines.
# Since we rely on clang-format version 17 and clang-format.ignored files 
# have only been introduced in version 18, we need to manually parse
# this list and throw out the matching files. This happens in t8indent.sh

# Each file that is listed here must have a comment describing why
# it is necessary to ignore indentation for this file.

# t8_with_macro_error.h has a hacky way of detecting
# the usage of macros using the character '@'.
# This causes clang to not recognize the file as a C++
# file and will throw an error when trying to indent it.
