Basic Installation
========================

  1. Clone the repository and update the submodules:

          git clone git@github.com:DLR-AMR/t8code.git
          cd t8code
          git submodule init
          git submodule update

  2. Create a build directory. CMake builds are done out-of-tree in a
     dedicated build directory. This is traditionally achieved by
     creating a ``build`` directory at the root of the repository:

          mkdir build
          cd build

  2. Invoke CMake. Configure your build of CMake, and generate the
     corresponding build files:

          cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="your favorite c compiler"     \
                   -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="your favorite c++ compiler" \
                   -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="your favorite compiler flags"  \
                   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release/Debug/RelWithDebInfo   \
                   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="path/to/install/folder"   \
                   -DT8CODE_BUILD_TUTORIALS=OFF

     You can add as many options as needed. A list of all the
     configuration options can be obtained using ccmake's TUI or are
     referenced in our Wiki [Installation guide]
     (https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code/wiki/Installation).

  3. Build and install t8code

          cmake --build . -j
          cmake --install

Linking against t8code in your own CMake-based project
======================================================

T8code can either be linked in-tree (i.e. meaning t8code source is a
subdirectory of your project) or you can link to an installed version
of t8code build with CMake (this is the recommended way). To link
in-tree, follow the next steps:

  1. Insert an ``add_subdirectory( path/to/t8code/sources )``
     instruction in your top level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.

  2. Add a ``target_link_libraries( your_target PRIVATE T8CODE::T8 )``
     instruction for each target depending on t8code

To link to an installed version of t8code, do the following:

  1. Add to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

          find_package( T8CODE REQUIRED )
          target_link_libraries( your_target PRIVATE T8CODE::T8 )

  2. When launching CMake, you may have to provide the root directory
     of t8code's installation:

          cmake /path/to/project -DT8CODE_ROOT=/path/to/t8code/install/dir
