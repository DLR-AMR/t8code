# Contributing

t8code is an open-source project and contributions from the community are much
appreciated. Please feel free to open issues or submit patches (preferably as
pull requests) any time.
For larger contributions, it is often beneficial to
get in contact with one of the principal developers first.
You can do so by opening a "feature request" issue.
