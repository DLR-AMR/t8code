## Tutorials

The steps examples lead step by step
through building an application with t8code.

step0 - Initialize t8code and print a welcome message.

step1 - Create a coarse mesh, output it to vtu and destroy it.

step2 - Create a uniform forest, 
	get its number of local and global elements,
	output it to vtu and destroy it.

step3 - Adapt a forest according to a user defined criterion.

step4 - Partitioning, balancing and creating ghost layer for forest.
        Explains the forest creation process in more detail.

step5 - Associating user data with a forest's elements. Exchanging
	ghost values for element user data. Writing element user data to vtu.


## To be implemented in the future

step6 - Changing a mesh with element data on it: Partitioning element data and
	interpolating data after adaptation.
