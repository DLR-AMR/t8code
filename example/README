The programs here are a collection of examples on the usage of t8code.
A brief description of the folders and programs:

 stepa  --  Step by step examples on how to build an application with t8code.
 basic  --  Programs generating and modifying a cube mesh.
            Call './t8_basic_hcube -h' for usage details.
 
 cmesh  --  Programs to read, write and partition a coarse (=input) mesh.

 triangle -- Load a mesh from the TRIANGLE mesh generator
 tetgen   -- Load a mesh from the TETGEN mesh generator
 gmsh     -- Load a mesh from teh GMSH mesh generator
 
 ghost    -- Rather involved testing programs for the ghost method.

 advect   -- A finite volume advection solver. This solver either computes 
             on a unit cube, or on a user provided gmsh mesh.
             It works in 2D and 3D with all supported element types and
             hybrid meshes.
             Call './t8_advection -h' for usage details
 netcdf   -- Eventually writing out meshes to netcdf format.
	     Currently, only a test program that prints a message whether or
	     not t8code was succesfully linked with netcdf.
