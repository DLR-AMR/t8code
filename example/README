The programs here are a collection of examples on the usage of t8code.
A brief description of the folders and programs:

advect      -- A finite volume advection solver. This solver either computes 
               on a unit cube, or on a user provided gmsh mesh.
               It works in 2D and 3D with all supported element types and
               hybrid meshes.
               Call './t8_advection -h' for usage details

IO          -- Options to read and write forests and cmeshes.

forest, cmesh, geometry -- Advanced usage examples for the main t8code objects.

common      -- common functions used in the examples

version     -- A program to illustrate version functionalities of t8code
