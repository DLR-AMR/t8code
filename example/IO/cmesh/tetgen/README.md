# TetGen I/O Examples

This folder contains examples that demonstrate how to read mesh files generated by [TetGen](http.www.tetgen.org/), a quality tetrahedral mesh generator and 3D Delaunay triangulator.

## Files

- `t8_read_tetgen_file.cxx`: A basic example that shows how to read TetGen's output files (`.node`, `.ele`) and construct a `t8_cmesh` from them.
- `t8_forest_from_tetgen.cxx`: A more advanced example that not only reads a TetGen mesh but also creates a `t8_forest` from it, demonstrating a more complete workflow from external mesh to a `t8code` forest.
- `t8_time_tetgen_file.cxx`: A utility program to measure the time it takes to read a TetGen file. This can be useful for performance analysis and benchmarking `t8code`'s I/O capabilities.

## Main Purpose

These examples are for users who use TetGen to create their 3D tetrahedral meshes and want to use them as input for `t8code`. They show the necessary steps to import such meshes into `t8code`'s data structures.

## How to Run

To run these examples, you will need a mesh generated by TetGen. The executables take the base name of the TetGen files as an argument.

```bash
# Example usage:
./t8_read_tetgen_file <path_to_your_mesh_basename>
```
For a mesh described by `mymesh.node` and `mymesh.ele`, the command would be `./t8_read_tetgen_file mymesh`. You will need to have TetGen support enabled in the `t8code` build configuration.
