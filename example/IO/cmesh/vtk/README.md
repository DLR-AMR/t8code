# VTK I/O Example

This folder contains an example for reading a coarse mesh from a VTK file.

## Files

- `t8_cmesh_read_from_vtk.cxx`: This program demonstrates how to read a mesh from a VTK file (`.vtu` or `.vtp`) and create a `t8_cmesh` from it. While `t8code` is often used to *write* VTK files for visualization, this shows it can also ingest them as a cmesh source.

## Main Purpose

This example is useful for workflows where the input mesh is provided in the VTK format. It allows users to leverage `t8code`'s capabilities on meshes generated by other tools that can export to VTK.

## How to Run

To build and run this example, `t8code` must be configured with VTK support enabled. The executable takes the path to the VTK file as a command-line argument.

```bash
# Example usage:
./t8_cmesh_read_from_vtk <path_to_your_mesh.vtu>
```
