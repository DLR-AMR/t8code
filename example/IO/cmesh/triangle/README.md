# Triangle I/O Example

This folder contains an example that demonstrates how to read mesh files generated by [Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html), a high-quality 2D mesh generator and Delaunay triangulator.

## Files

- `t8_read_triangle_file.cxx`: This program shows how to read Triangle's output files (`.node`, `.ele`) and initialize a 2D `t8_cmesh` from them.

## Main Purpose

This example is intended for users who use Triangle to generate their 2D unstructured meshes and want to import them into `t8code` for simulation or other processing.

## How to Run

To build and run this example, `t8code` must be configured with Triangle support enabled. The executable takes the base name of the Triangle files as a command-line argument.

```bash
# If your mesh is defined by mymesh.node and mymesh.ele:
./t8_read_triangle_file mymesh
```
