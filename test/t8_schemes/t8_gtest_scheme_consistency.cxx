/* TODO: In this file we want to define test that check whether
 *       an eclass_scheme is consistent.
 *       Before implementing the tests, we want to collect everything
 *       that we need to check here:
 * Possible checks:
 *    - the parent of the children is the original element
 *    - an element is one of the children of its parent
 *    - the face neighbor of the face neighbor is the original element
 *    - lower-dimensional refinement of the boundary is consistent with
 *      the element refinement (how to check?)
 *          - refine + take boundary at face = take boundary at face + refine
 *          - maxlevel of boundary >= maxlevel of element
 *          - num_face_children matches num_children of the face
 *          - corner_face is correct?
 *    - child_eclass matches eclass of child
 *    - basic functionality tests (i.e. copy creates a copy, compare does what it is supposed to)
 *    - sibling ids and childids of parent match
 *    - the children are a family
 *    - extrude_face and boundary_face are inverse to each other
 *    - successor and predecessor are inverse to each other
 *    TODO: continue this list
