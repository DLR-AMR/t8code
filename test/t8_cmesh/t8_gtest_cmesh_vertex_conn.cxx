/** \file In this file we test the global cmesh vertex numbers.
 * 
 * We build a test cmesh consisting of two coarse triangles joined together
 * and associate global vertex numbers with the cmesh's vertices.
 * This cmesh has 4 global vertices in total.
 * 
 * We then perform three tests
 * 
 * 1) check_tree_to_vertex
 * Here we test the tree_to_vertex connectivity.
 * That is, given a tree id, we get a list of the global vertices of that tree
 * (in local vertex order) and check whether this list is correct.
 * 
 * 2) check_vertex_to_tree
 * Here we test the vertex_to_tree connectivity.
 * Given a global vertex index, the vertex_to_tree connectivity returns a list
 * of pairs (local tree_id, local_vertex_id) of all the local trees and their local
 * vertices that are connected to the global vertex.
 * We check whether this list is correct.
 * 
 * 3) check_global_vertex_number
 * We verify that the number of global vertices is 4.
 * We additionally verify that the process local number of global vertices is 4 as well.
 * This is true, since the cmesh is not partitioned.
 * 
 * Additionally, t8_test_cmesh_vertex_conn_partitioned is the start of a test
 * suite with partitioned cmesh that is currently disabled and could be enabled and extended
 * when cmesh vertex connectivity supports partitioned cmeshes.
 * Note that the test itself then has to be set to parallel in the CMake file.
