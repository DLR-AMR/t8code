/* Test the t8_cmesh_set_attribute_gloidx_array and t8_cmesh_get_attribute_gloidx_array functions.
 * We create a cmesh with two trees and add an array with N entries to each tree.
 * The first tree has data_persists = 0, the second data_persists = 1.
 * Then we get the array and check whether it's entries are correct.
 * We parametrize the test over the number of entries N and the treeid (0 or 1).
 * Thus for each element count N, we do one test for the first tree and one for the second tree.
