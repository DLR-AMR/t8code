# Fortran Interface Tests

This folder contains tests for the Fortran interface of t8code.

## Files

- `t8_test_mpi_init.f90`: This test checks the initialization of MPI from the Fortran interface.

## Main Features

The tests in this folder ensure that the Fortran API of t8code is working correctly and can be used to interact with the library from Fortran applications.

## How to Run

These tests are part of the main test suite and are executed when you run the `t8_gtest_main` executable. You need to have a Fortran compiler and MPI enabled to build and run these tests.
