# t8_vector_helper Tests

This folder contains tests for vector helper functions. These functions likely provide utility operations for working with standard vectors or custom vector-like data structures in `t8code`.

## Files

- `t8_gtest_vector_split.cxx`: This test verifies the functionality of a `vector_split` function. This function is probably used to partition or divide a vector into multiple sub-vectors, a common operation in parallel processing and data distribution.

## Main Purpose

The tests in this directory ensure that the helper functions for vector manipulations are correct. These utilities can help simplify code and improve performance in other parts of the library.

## How to Run

These tests are part of the main test suite and are executed when you run the `t8_gtest_main` executable.
