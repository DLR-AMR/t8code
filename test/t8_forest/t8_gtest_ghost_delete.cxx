/* This test is executed on a subcommunicator of exactly 2 procs, because it demonstrates a configuration that is currently not working. See https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code/issues/825.
 * A partitioned square of uniform refinement level 1 is adapted once, where only the lower half is refined.
 * Then the mesh is adapted again, where only the upper half of the lower elements is deleted.
 * Now, no element actually has a face connection to an existing element on the other proc, thus the Ghost structure should be empty.
 * Within the bug discussed in https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code/issues/825 they send a message anyway.
 * Once, https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code/issues/825 is resolved, no messages should be send and the test should pass.
