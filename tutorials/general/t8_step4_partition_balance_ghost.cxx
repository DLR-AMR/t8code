/* See also: https://github.com/holke/t8code/wiki/Step-4---Partition,-Balance,-Ghost
 *
 * This is step4 of the t8code tutorials.
 * After generating a coarse mesh (step1), building a uniform forest
 * on it (step2) and adapting this forest (step3) 
 * we will now lear how to control the forest creation in more detail,
 * how to partition and balance a forest and how to generate a layer of ghost elements.
 * 
 * Partition: Each forest is distributed among the MPI processes. Partitioning a forest means
 *            to change this distribution in order to maintain a load balance. After we 
 *            applied partition to a forest the new forest will have equal numbers of elements
 *            on each process (+- 1).
 *            In our example we start with a uniform forest from a cmesh. This forest is constructed
 *            such that each process has the same number of elements. 
 *            We then adapt this forest, thus refining and coarsening its elements. This changes the
 *            number of elements on each process and will almost always result in a load imbalance.
 *            You can verify this yourself by printing the process local number on each process for the 
 *            adapted forest (for example with t8_productionf).
 *            In order to reestablish a load balance, we will construct a new forest from the adapted
 *            one via the partition feature.
 * 
 * Ghost:     Many applications require a layer of ghost elements. Ghost element of a process are 
 *            those elements that are not local to this process but have a (face) neighbor element that is.
 *            Telling a forest to create a ghost layer will gather all necessary information and give
 *            us access to the ghost elements.
 *            t8code does not create a layer of ghost elements by default, thus our initial uniform forest
 *            and the adapted forest will not have one.
 * 
 * Balance:   A forest fulfills the balance property if (and only if) for each element its (face) neighbors
 *            have refinement level at most +1 or -1 in comparison to the element's level.
 *            The balance property is often broken after adaptation. The Balance algorithm iterates through
 *            the mesh and restores the balance property by refining elements if necessary.
 *            Balance will never coarsen any elements.
 *            t8code does not balance a forest by default.
 *            Our initial uniform forest is balanced since every element has the same refinement level l.
 *            Our adaptation criterion is such that (usually) after one step of adaptation the forest will still be balanced,
 *            since we have level l+1 elements in the inner sphere, level l elements in the middle and level l+1 elements
 *            outside. This may not be the case for very small initial refinement levels levels or with different radius thresholds (why don't you try it out?).
 *            Therefore, in this example we will apply the adaptation two times, resulting in level l+2 elements
 *            in the inner sphere, level l elements in the middle and level l - 2 element in the outer sphere
 *            (and probably some, but not many, level l-1 and level l+1 elements in between).
 *            This forest will be unbalanced and we will then apply the balance routine to it.
 *            Note that balance changes the local number of elements and thus may also change the load balance
 *            and hence require repartitioning.
 *            Balance is usually the most expensive of t8code's mesh manipulation algorithms.
 * 
 * How you can experiment here:
 *    Partition:
 *         - Test the program with different numbers of processes and compare the local
 *           number of elements before and after partitioning.
 *         - Open the vtu files before and after partitioning and color them by mpirank in order
 *           to see how the distribution of elements changes.
 *    Ghost:
 *         - We actually print the ghost elements in the vtu files and you can look at them.
 *           Ghost elements have treeid = -1 in the vtu files. To view the ghosts of a single process (say process 1)
 *           you can set a threshold on mpirank to view only the elements of process 1 and then set a threshold
 *           on treeid to only view those elements with treeid = -1.
 *    Balance:
 *         - View the unbalanced and balanced forest vtu files and compare them.
 *           You can color the elements by level.       
 *         - Exercise: Apply balance to forest_adapt and not to the twice adapted forest.
 *         - Set the no_repartition flag of t8_forest_set_balance to true and observe how the
 *           partition of the resulting forest changes.

/* So far we have seen t8_forest_new_* functions to create forests.
   * These directly returned a new forest.
   * However, t8code offers us more control over the creation of forests.
   * For example we can control whether or not a forest should have a ghost layer,
   * be balanced/partitioned from another forest, etc.
   * 
   * Usually, there are three steps involved in creating a forest:
   * 1. Initialize the forest with t8_forest_init.
   *      This function will prepare a forest by setting default values for its members and 
   *      initializing necessary structures.
   * 2. Set all properties that the forest should have.
   *      Here we can for example set a cmesh and refinement scheme or specify that the
   *      forest should be adapted/partitioned/balanced from another forest etc.
   *      See the t8_forest_set functions in t8_forest.h
   *      The order in which you call the set functions does not matter.
   * 3. Commit the forest with t8_forest_commit. 
   *      In this step the forest is actually created after setting all
   *      desired properties. The forest cannot be changed after it was committed.   
   * 
   * The t8_forest_new functions are just wrappers around this process.
