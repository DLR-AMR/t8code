/* See also: https://github.com/holke/t8code/wiki/Step-5---Store-element-data
 *
 * This is step5 of the t8code tutorials using the C interface of t8code.
 * In the following we will store data in the individual elements of our forest. 
 * To do this, we will again create a uniform forest, which will get adapted as in step4, 
 * with the difference that we partition, balance and create ghost elements all in the same step.
 * After adapting the forest we will learn how to build a data array and gather data for 
 * the local elements. Furthermore, we exchange the data values of the ghost elements and
 * output the volume data to vtu.
 *
 * How you can experiment here:
 *   - Look at the paraview output files of the adapted forest.
 *     You can apply a clip filter to look into the cube. Also you can apply (in addition) 
 *     the threshold filter to display only elements with certain properties.
 *     But at first you may just want to enter the tooltip selection mode 'Hover Cells On'
 *     to display cell information when hover over them.
 *   - Change the adaptation criterion as you wish to adapt elements or families as desired.
 *   - Store even more data per element, for instance the coordinates of its midpoint.
 *     You can again apply the threshold filter to your new data. Don't forget to write the 
 *     data into the output file.
