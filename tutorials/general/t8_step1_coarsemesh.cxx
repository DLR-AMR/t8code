/* See also: https://github.com/holke/t8code/wiki/Step-1---Creating-a-coarse-mesh
 *
 * In this example we build a coarse mesh with a cube geometry.
 * The cube is meshed with 6 coarse tetrahedra.
 * We then output it in vtu format and destroy it.
 * 
 * How you can experiment here:
 *  - Use Paraview to visualize the output files.
 *  - Change the parameters of t8_cmesh_new_hypercube
 *    You can change the element shape or switch to a partitioned cmesh or use
 *    periodic boundaries.
 *  - Exchange t8_cmesh_new_hypercube with any other t8_cmesh_new function
 *    from t8_cmesh.h to create a different cmesh.
