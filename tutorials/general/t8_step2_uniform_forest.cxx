/* See also: https://github.com/holke/t8code/wiki/Step-2---Creating-a-uniform-forest
 *
 * After we learned how to create a cmesh in step1, we will
 * now build our first partitioned forest, get its local and global
 * element count, and output it into .vtu files.
 * 
 * When we create a forest from a coarse mesh, the forest will always be
 * uniform (every element has the same refinement level) and can then be adapted
 * later (see the following steps).
 * Together with the cmesh, we also need a refinement scheme. This scheme tells the
 * forest how elements of each shape (t8_eclass_t) are refined, what their neighbor
 * are etc.
 * The default scheme in t8_schemes/t8_default/t8_default_cxx.hxx provides an implementation for
 * all element shapes that t8code supports (with pyramids currently under construction).
 * 
 * How you can experiment here:
 *  - Use Paraview to visualize the output files.
 *  - Execute this program with different numbers of processes.
 *  - Change the initial refinement level.
 *  - Use a different cmesh (See step1).
 *  - Look into t8_forest.h and try to get different information about the
 *    forest (for example the number of local trees).
