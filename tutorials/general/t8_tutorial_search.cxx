/* See also: https://github.com/holke/t8code/wiki/Tutorial:-Search
 * In this tutorial we discuss t8code's search algorithm.
 * search is a powerful tool to identify leaf elements that match a given condition
 * and execute a function on them.
 * 
 * In the example we will create random 'particles', thus points in a subdomain of our domain,
 * and then use search to find those leaf elements that contain particles and for each element
 * count the number of particles it contains.
 * 
 * How you can experiment here:
 *    - Load the generated vtu files with paraview and add a threshold to the
 *      "Number of particles" field to display the elements with 1 or more particles.
 *      This shows you the distribution of the particles in the domain and which elements
 *      contain particles.
 *    - Change the number of particles, the subdomain of the particles etc.
 *    - Try to find a different criterion to search for and implement it.
 *    - Do not count particles in elements whose x-coordinates are all smaller than 0.5 .
 *    - Advanced: Use adapt to refine elements with more than 1 particle in them recursively until each
 *                element contains at most 1 particle.
 * 
 * 
 * The search algorithm does not iterate linearly through our elements, instead 
 * it traverses recursively through the mesh hierarchy. This has the benefit, that we
 * can exclude whole regions of the mesh from our search as soon as we can determine that
 * they will not match the criterion.
 * You can see in the output of this program that the number of searched elements is
 * significantly smaller than the actual number of elements.
 * 
 * In each (process local) tree of the forest, search will create the level 0 element that
 * coincides with the tree and call the search-callback function on it.
 * In the callback the user decides whether to continue the search or not.
 * If we continue the search, the children of this level 0 element are created and the
 * search callback will be called for them -- again deciding whether to continue or not.
 * This process repeats recursively and stops at those fine elements that are actually contained
 * in the forest (leaf elements).
 * 
 * The search algorithm can be given an array of 'queries' and a query-callback. 
 * These queries can be arbitrarily defined data. In our case this will be the array of particles.
 * If queries and a query-callback are provided, then for each element first the search-callback
 * is called to decide whether or not to continue searching. If it returns true, the query-callback
 * will be called once for each active query object. 
 * If the query object returns 0, this query object will get deactivated for this element and its
 * recursive children. The recursion stops when no queries are active anymore.
 * 
 * It is probably best to illustrate this with an example. Let the following forest
 * with 2 quad trees be given.
 *  __ __ __ __ __________
 * |__|__|  *  |          |
 * |_*|_*|__ __|  *       |
 * |__|__|__|__|    *     |
 * |__|__|__|__|__________|
 * 
 * The '*' should mark particles for which we want to find the elements containing them.
 * These particles are our queries. Let us enumerate them 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 from left to right.
 * The search should always continue for an element as long as we still may have particles to look for,
 * thus the search callback can always return true. The query-callback will return true if
 * and only if the current particle is contained inside the element.
 * We discuss the search process in the left tree.
 * 
 *   __ __ __ __                                         __ __ __ __
 *  |        *  |                                       |     |  *  |
 *  | *  *      |  *                                    |_* _*|__ __|
 *  |           |      *                        --->    |     |     |
 *  |__ __ __ __|                                       |__ __|__ __|
 * 
 *  At first, the tree element is considered            The children are created and the search is called 
 *  and all queries are active. The first 3 are         for each one of them. For the upper left, queries 0 and 1
 *  inside the element, the last 2 not. Thus the        will remain active. The upper right is the final forest leaf, so the search stops.
 *  search will continue, but only queries 0, 1, 2      For the bottom two children no queries will remain active 
 *  remain active.                                      and hence the search won't continue here.
 * 
 *  __ __ 
 * |__|__|
 * |_*|_*|
 * 
 *  The search continues with the children of the upper left element.
 *  Those are all leafs in the forest and hence the search will stop after
 *  executing the query callback.
 *  
 *  Afterwards the search will continue simarly in the second tree.
 * 
 *  Note that the performance of the search could be improved by using an approximative check
 *  on all but the leaf elements.
 *  This check should return true whenenever a particle is inside an element, but may have false positives.
