/* This is step3 of the t8code tutorials.
 * After generating a coarse mesh (step1) and building a uniform forest
 * on it (step2), we will now adapt (= refine and coarsen) the forest
 * according to our own criterion.
 * 
 * The geometry (coarse mesh) is again a cube, this time modelled with
 * 6 tetrahedra, 6 prisms and 4 cubes.
 * We refine an element if its midpoint is within a sphere of given radius
 * around the point (0.5, 0.5, 1) and we coarsen outside of a given radius.
 * We will use non-recursive refinement, that means that the refinement level
 * of any element will change by at most +-1.
 * 
 * How you can experiment here:
 *   - Look at the paraview output files of the unifomr and the adapted forest.
 *     For the adapted forest you can apply a slice filter to look into the cube.
 *   - Run the program with different process numbers. You should see that refining is
 *     independent of the number of processes, but coarsening is not.
 *     This is due to the face that a family can only be coarsened if it is completely
 *     local to a single process and the distribution among the process may break this property.
 *   - Change the midpoint coordinates and the radii.
 *   - Change the adaptation criterion such that elements inside the sphere are coarsened
 *     and elements outside are refined.
 *   - Use t8_productionf to print the local number of elements on each process.
 *     Notice, that the uniform forest is evenly distributed, but that the adapted forest
 *     is not. This is due to the fact that we do not repartition our forest here.
 *   - Add a maximum refinement level to the adapt_data struct and use non-recursive refinement.
 *     Do not refine an element if it has reached the maximum level. (Hint: ts->t8_element_level)
