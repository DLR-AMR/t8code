/* See also: https://github.com/DLR-AMR/t8code/wiki/Feature---Curved-meshes
 *
 * This is a feature tutorial about curved meshes.
 * In the following we will generate an input mesh and input geometry in Gmsh. 
 * Furthermore, we will read those files in and build a curved forest with them.
 * As refinement criterion we will define a wall which is moving through the mesh
 * and we will refine elements based on their neighboring geometrical geometries.
 * Lastly, we will output the curved meshes as vtk.
 *
 * How you can experiment here:
 *   - Change the meshsize of the input mesh to take a look at is influence
 *     on the resulting forest.
 *   - Refine the mesh at different geometries.
