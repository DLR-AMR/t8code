# This github CI script installs t8code and runs its tests for various configurations.
# We compile sc and p4est as thirdparty libraries and use caching to only trigger a
# new installation of them when their versions have changed in t8code.
#
# Note: To manually enforce sc and p4est installation, either increase the counter
#       in the "key:" entries of the sc and p4est steps or set the variables
#       SC_IGNORE_CACHE and P4EST_IGNORE_CACHE to 1 in the respective steps.
