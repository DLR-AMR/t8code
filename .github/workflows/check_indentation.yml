# This github CI script checks whether all code files in the t8code 
# repository are indented according to the indentation conventions.
# It is triggered for pull requests into main and develop and will also run once a day
# on main.
#
# The script runs the scripts/check_if_all_files_indented.scp script of t8code.
# The output is uploaded as an artifact to the github page.
