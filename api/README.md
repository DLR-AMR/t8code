This directory contains Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for using `t8code` from languages other than C/C++.

## Subfolders

- [**t8_fortran_interface/**](t8_fortran_interface/README.md): Contains the source code for the Fortran interface to `t8code`.

## Main Purpose

The APIs in this folder provide language-specific bindings that allow developers to call `t8code`'s core functionalities from different programming environments. This broadens the library's usability and allows it to be integrated into a wider range of scientific computing applications.
